# Trivia

## Description
Trivia is a classic game where the user gets to test their desired categories with a multitude of questions that operate as somewhat mind boggling questions. Usually trivia gives choices and they can be tricky in order to decieve the user, other times they are just generic questions. Sometimes they come with themes, or they are sometimes generic. The game that I'm creating is a generic trivia game, aiming to ask medium-hard questions, and there is a score that tracks your correct guesses. Can you get the high score?

## Planning
- Generated questions, obtained from ![Codebreaker](https://www.quizbreaker.com/trivia-questions)
- Created simple HTML, then instantly began with the logic.
- Whether question is right or wrong, proceed to the next question.
- If right, give points, and display they are correct and no points with a incorrect message if they get it wrong.
- Buttons created for each instance.
